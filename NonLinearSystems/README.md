### 1_FixedPointIterationMethod.c: Fixed-Point Iteration Method for Solving Nonlinear Equations

The system of nonlinear equations to be solved is:

$$ x_1^2 - 10x_1 + x_2^2 + 8 = 0 $$
$$ x_1 x_2^2 + x_1 - 10x_2 + 8 = 0 $$

The goal is to find the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$ that satisfy both equations simultaneously.
The initial guess is $x^{(0)} = [0.1,0.1]^T$
