    "### Governing Equation - Strong vs Weak Formulation\n",
    "The governing differential equation for the static structural problem of the 1D Bar is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Δu(x) = -f(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ Δ $ represents the Laplacian operator. This equation is well known as the Poisson's equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "By expanding the laplacian for the 1D Bar problem we end up with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial ^ 2u(x)}{\\partial x^2} = -f(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the \"Strong form\" of the Poisson's equation. This equation can provide the exact solution for particular (finite) points inside the domain or for particular points at the boundaries, caclulated by solving the respective equations for the boundaries (they can be Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin). However, both the domain and boundaries are described by an infinite number of points and in between the selected/particular points for the exact solution of the strong form equations we will end up probably with oscillations, unveiling a huge drawback of the strong form methods. To provide a control between the selected points of the equations the Weak Formulation is recommended instead. As an example we could apply an averaging technique between the particular points of the domain, which is somewhat the case in Finite Element Analysis (FEA) as well. We will not cover the whole derivation procedure for the Weak Formulation of the Poisson's equation but the basic idea behind it is that we multiply the strong form by a test function (the so-called weight function) and integrate over the domain. The test functions are chosen specifically for each problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Weak Formulation with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions\n",
    "So, returning back to our methodology, to derive the weak formulation we multiply the strong form by a test function $ v(x) $ and integrate over the domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_Ω  \\frac{\\partial ^ 2u(x)}{\\partial x^2}v(x) dΩ = - \\int_Ω f(x)v(x) dΩ\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the integration by parts (Green's Theorem) to the left-hand side to move the derivative from $ u(x) $ to the test function $ v(x) $ we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{\\partial^2 u(x)}{\\partial x^2}v(x) dx = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} v(x) \\right]_{a}^{b} - \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial v(x)}{\\partial x} dx \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the term $ \\left[ \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} v(x) \\right]_{a}^{b} $ is the boundary term evaluated at the boundaries of the domain $ a $ and $ B$ . For the domain $ Ω = [0,1] $ this becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left[ \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} v(x) \\right]_{0}^{1} - \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial v(x)}{\\partial x} \\, dx \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming Dirichlet boundary conditions, where $ u(0) = u(1) = 0 $ we also consider $ v(0)=v(1)=0$. This simplifies the boundary term to zero because the test function $ v(x) $ is zero at the boundaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left[ \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} v(x) \\right]_{0}^{1} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the weak form of the equation reduces to:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial v(x)}{\\partial x} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x)v(x)\\, dx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Boundary Conditions - Further Explanation (Optional)\n",
    "In the weak form, the boundary conditions are naturally incorporated through the choice of test functions. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, the test functions are chosen such that they are zero at the boundaries. This ensures that the boundary terms vanish, simplifying the formulation. For Neumann or Robin boundary conditions, the boundary term would not vanish and would need to be included in the weak form. The weak form provides a flexible and stable way to incorporate these conditions and solve the problem numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This can also be found as:\n",

    "In the context of the finite element method and isogeometric analysis, the choice of approximating the solution $ u(x) $ and the test function $ v(x) $ using a finite set of basis function $ N_i(x) $ and $ N_j(x)$, respectively, is grounded in the method of weighted residuals and the principle of Galerkin's method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted Residuals and Galerkin's Method\n",
    "The primary goal in numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) is to approximate the continuous solution $ u(x) $ by a discrete function that satisfies the PDE in an average sense over the domain. This is achieved through the method of weighted residuals, where the residual (the error in satisfying the PDE) is minimized in an integral sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weighted Residuals\n",
    "The idea behind the weighted residuals method is to convert the differential equation into an integral form where the residuals (errors) are weighted and forced to be zero over the domain. The residual $ R(u) $ of the differential equation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R(u) = - \\frac{\\partial^2u(x)}{\\partial x^2} - f(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the residuals are minimized, we integrate the residual multiplied by a set of weighting functions $ v(x) $ over the domain:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_Ω R(u)v(x)\\, dΩ = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Galerkin's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubnov-Galerkin's method is a specific case of the weighted residuals method where the weighting functions are chosen to be the same as the basis functions used to approximate the solution. This means we use the basis functions $ N_j(x) $ as our weight functions:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_Ω (- \\frac{\\partial^2u(x)}{\\partial x^2} - f(x))N_j(x)\\, dΩ = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw previously the technique for eliminating the second derivative by intergating by parts, thus by applying the same principle for the enclosed in parentheses term we end up with:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_Ω \\frac{\\partial^2u(x)}{\\partial x^2} N_j(x) dΩ = -\\int_Ω \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial Ν_j(x)}{\\partial x} dΩ\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting this into the weighted residuals equation we get:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_Ω \\nabla u(x) \\nabla N_j(x)\\, dΩ = \\int_Ω f(x)N_j(x)\\, dΩ\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximation of $ u(x)$, $ v(x) $ using Basis Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we approximate the solution $ u(x) $ as a linear combination of basis functions $ N_{i}(x)$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u(x) = \\sum_{i=Ι} u_iNi(x) \n",

    "and\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v(x) = N_{j}(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$u_{i}$: in case of Isogeometric Analysis these coefficients correspond to the control points. These control points are the unknowns that we solve for in the system of equations. In IGA, the geometry of the domain and the approximation of the solution are both represented using the same set of basis functions (e.g., B-splines or NURBS). The process involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Geometry Representation: The physical geometry of the domain is defined using control points and basis functions. For example, the shape of the domain is represented as a combination of basis functions and their corresponding control points in the geometric space.\n",
    "- Solution Approximation: The approximate solution $ u(x) $ is expressed as a linear combination of the same basis functions used for geometry, but with a different set of control points that represent the solution values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the control points in the solution approximation are analogous to nodal values in the traditional finite element method (FEM). They represent the values of the solution at specific locations in the parametric domain, which are determined by solving the system of equations derived from the weak form of the governing differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it all ties together:\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis functions $ N_{i}(x) $ are predefined and depend on the choice of the knot vector and the degree of the basis functions.\n",
    "The control points $ u_i $ are the unknowns that we need to determine. They scale the basis functions to construct the approximate solution\n",
    "$u(x)$.\n",

    "Let's assume that we want to use Cubic basis functions instead of the Quadratic ones we used in our previous analysis steps.This can be found elsewhere as p-refinement, which is the method where the degree of the basis functions used for representing the geometry is increased. Firstly, we will need to adjust the knot vector for the higher order basis fucntions. When we perform degree elevation from degree $ p $ to degree $ p + 1$, the multiplicity of the knots is typically increased to maintain the same continuity across the knots. We basically need to increase the multiplicity of all knots so that the continuity requirements are met, as before. The knot vector will now become:\n",

The traction force of $ 10 kN/m $ is applied at both ends in x-direction. The plate is modeled by taking two linear elements in both $u$ and $v$ directions. Since two linear elements are considered, three control points are required along each parametric direction, which results in a total of nine control points. \n",

    "\n",
    "- The Kronecker Product method can simplify the construction of a global stiffness matrix by leveraging tensor products, especially when the problem has separable properties along the u- and v- directions, as in some simplified plate models. In this approach, you are trying to move from the 1D stiffness matrix (like a bar) to a 2D stiffness matrix (like a plate) by constructing the global stiffness matrix as a Kronecker product of two 1D matrices. Without the $B$ and $D$ matrices, you’re essentially working with a simplified model where the strain-displacement relationship might be implicit or trivial. The Kronecker product approach is mainly geometric — it’s less about the detailed mechanics and more about assembling the matrix structure based on pre-computed 1D solutions. The Challenge: Without the $B$ matrix (strain-displacement) and $D$ matrix (material properties), you are not explicitly capturing how nodal displacements lead to internal strains within the element. In finite element analysis (FEA) and some isogeometric analysis (IGA) applications, these matrices are fundamental to linking the displacements of the control points (knots) to the actual deformation and stress distribution inside the element. If your problem is sufficiently simple, or if it's known that displacements and strains are related in a direct way (such as uniform or linear strain distribution  across the element), you can get away with using the Kronecker product. But in general, for more complex or realistic problems, omitting $B$ and $D$ will not give accurate results for strain-stress relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Minimum Potential Energy Theorem with B and D matrices is the more general and robust approach used in FEA or IGA. The strain-displacement matrix B is derived from the shape functions, and the constitutive matrix D represents the material properties. These are used to form the element's stiffness matrix. The B matrix links the displacements of the element's control points (knots in IGA or nodes in traditional FEA) to the strains inside the element. Strains are computed as the gradient of the displacement field, and the B matrix encodes this relationship. The D matrix, meanwhile, relates these strains to stresses via the material's constitutive law (e.g. Hooke's law for linear elasticity).\n",

    "In finite element analysis (FEA), the constitutive matrix $D$ plays a key role in relating stress and strain within a material according to the material's constitutive law. It is sometimes referred to as the material stiffness matrix, and its form depends on the type of material and the dimensionality of the problem (1D, 2D, 3D). Here's an explanation of $D$ and its significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Definition of the Constitutive Matrix $D$**\n",
    "\n",
    "The constitutive matrix $D$ relates the stress vector $\\sigma$ to the strain vector $\\varepsilon$ through the constitutive equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma = D \\varepsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ \\sigma $ is the stress vector, typically containing components like normal and shear stresses.\n",
    "- $ \\varepsilon $ is the strain vector, containing normal and shear strains.\n",
    "- $ D $ is the constitutive matrix that encodes the material properties like Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio for isotropic materials, or more complex behavior for anisotropic materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Form of the Constitutive Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "The form of $D$ depends on the type of material and the dimensionality of the problem. For simplicity, let's consider two common cases: plane stress and plane strain in 2D analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### a) **Plane Stress Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of plane stress, the stress state is assumed to be zero in the thickness direction (e.g., thin plates). The constitutive matrix $D$ for an isotropic material in plane stress is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2}\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & \\nu & 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\nu & 1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & \\frac{1 - \\nu}{2}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $E$ is Young's modulus (elastic modulus),\n",
    "- $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix relates the normal stresses $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$, as well as the shear stress $\\tau_{xy}$, to the corresponding strains $\\varepsilon_x$, $\\varepsilon_y$, and $\\gamma_{xy}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### b) **Plane Strain Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of plane strain (e.g., thick structures where strains in the thickness direction are negligible), the constitutive matrix for an isotropic material is slightly different:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D = \\frac{E}{(1 + \\nu)(1 - 2\\nu)}\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 - \\nu & \\nu & 0 \\\\\n",

    "0 & 0 & \\frac{1 - 2\\nu}{2}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In plane strain, there is no strain in the out-of-plane direction, but the stress in that direction is not zero. This requires modifying the constitutive matrix compared to the plane stress case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **3D Constitutive Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "For 3D problems, the constitutive matrix $D$ becomes a 6x6 matrix, taking into account the three normal stresses and three shear stresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D = \\frac{E}{(1 + \\nu)(1 - 2\\nu)}\n",

    "0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1 - 2\\nu}{2}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This form is more general and applies to 3D elements where stresses and strains occur in all three directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Summary of $D$**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The constitutive matrix $D$ encapsulates the material properties and links stress to strain.\n",
    "- Its specific form depends on the type of material behavior (isotropic, anisotropic, etc.) and the dimensionality (2D plane stress/strain, 3D).\n",
    "- For isotropic materials, $D$ is usually expressed in terms of Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$, but for more complex materials, $D$ can include other parameters like shear modulus, thermal expansion, or even anisotropic coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $D$ serves as a fundamental tool in converting the strains computed from nodal displacements into stresses, which are critical for determining material behavior under load.\n"

The procedure for calculating the coordinates for the 2D case will be the exact same as for the 1D Bar with the difference that there will be the same calculations for both $ξ$ as well as for $η$ direction. So we will basically end up with 2x2 Gaussian Quadrature inside each element which lead to 4 integration points for each element, thus a total of 16 integration points for the whole plate.
