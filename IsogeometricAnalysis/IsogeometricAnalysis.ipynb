    "### Governing Equation - Strong vs Weak Formulation\n",
    "The governing differential equation for the static structural problem of the 1D Bar is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Δu(x) = -f(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ Δ $ represents the Laplacian operator. This equation is well known as the Poisson's equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "By expanding the laplacian for the 1D Bar problem we end up with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial ^ 2u(x)}{\\partial x^2} = -f(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the \"Strong form\" of the Poisson's equation. This equation can provide the exact solution for particular (finite) points inside the domain or for particular points at the boundaries, caclulated by solving the respective equations for the boundaries (they can be Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin). However, both the domain and boundaries are described by an infinite number of points and in between the selected/particular points for the exact solution of the strong form equations we will end up probably with oscillations, unveiling a huge drawback of the strong form methods. To provide a control between the selected points of the equations the Weak Formulation is recommended instead. As an example we could apply an averaging technique between the particular points of the domain, which is somewhat the case in Finite Element Analysis (FEA) as well. We will not cover the whole derivation procedure for the Weak Formulation of the Poisson's equation but the basic idea behind it is that we multiply the strong form by a test function (the so-called weight function) and integrate over the domain. The test functions are chosen specifically for each problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Weak Formulation with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions\n",
    "So, returning back to our methodology, to derive the weak formulation we multiply the strong form by a test function $ v(x) $ and integrate over the domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_Ω  \\frac{\\partial ^ 2u(x)}{\\partial x^2}v(x) dΩ = - \\int_Ω f(x)v(x) dΩ\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the integration by parts (Green's Theorem) to the left-hand side to move the derivative from $ u(x) $ to the test function $ v(x) $ we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{\\partial^2 u(x)}{\\partial x^2}v(x) dx = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} v(x) \\right]_{a}^{b} - \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial v(x)}{\\partial x} dx \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the term $ \\left[ \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} v(x) \\right]_{a}^{b} $ is the boundary term evaluated at the boundaries of the domain $ a $ and $ B$ . For the domain $ Ω = [0,1] $ this becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left[ \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} v(x) \\right]_{0}^{1} - \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial v(x)}{\\partial x} \\, dx \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming Dirichlet boundary conditions, where $ u(0) = u(1) = 0 $ we also consider $ v(0)=v(1)=0$. This simplifies the boundary term to zero because the test function $ v(x) $ is zero at the boundaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left[ \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} v(x) \\right]_{0}^{1} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the weak form of the equation reduces to:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial v(x)}{\\partial x} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x)v(x)\\, dx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Boundary Conditions - Further Explanation (Optional)\n",
    "In the weak form, the boundary conditions are naturally incorporated through the choice of test functions. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, the test functions are chosen such that they are zero at the boundaries. This ensures that the boundary terms vanish, simplifying the formulation. For Neumann or Robin boundary conditions, the boundary term would not vanish and would need to be included in the weak form. The weak form provides a flexible and stable way to incorporate these conditions and solve the problem numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This can also be found as:\n",

    "In the context of the finite element method and isogeometric analysis, the choice of approximating the solution $ u(x) $ and the test function $ v(x) $ using a finite set of basis function $ N_i(x) $ and $ N_j(x)$, respectively, is grounded in the method of weighted residuals and the principle of Galerkin's method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted Residuals and Galerkin's Method\n",
    "The primary goal in numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) is to approximate the continuous solution $ u(x) $ by a discrete function that satisfies the PDE in an average sense over the domain. This is achieved through the method of weighted residuals, where the residual (the error in satisfying the PDE) is minimized in an integral sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weighted Residuals\n",
    "The idea behind the weighted residuals method is to convert the differential equation into an integral form where the residuals (errors) are weighted and forced to be zero over the domain. The residual $ R(u) $ of the differential equation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R(u) = - \\frac{\\partial^2u(x)}{\\partial x^2} - f(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the residuals are minimized, we integrate the residual multiplied by a set of weighting functions $ v(x) $ over the domain:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_Ω R(u)v(x)\\, dΩ = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Galerkin's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubnov-Galerkin's method is a specific case of the weighted residuals method where the weighting functions are chosen to be the same as the basis functions used to approximate the solution. This means we use the basis functions $ N_j(x) $ as our weight functions:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_Ω (- \\frac{\\partial^2u(x)}{\\partial x^2} - f(x))N_j(x)\\, dΩ = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw previously the technique for eliminating the second derivative by intergating by parts, thus by applying the same principle for the enclosed in parentheses term we end up with:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_Ω \\frac{\\partial^2u(x)}{\\partial x^2} N_j(x) dΩ = -\\int_Ω \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial Ν_j(x)}{\\partial x} dΩ\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting this into the weighted residuals equation we get:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_Ω \\nabla u(x) \\nabla N_j(x)\\, dΩ = \\int_Ω f(x)N_j(x)\\, dΩ\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximation of $ u(x)$, $ v(x) $ using Basis Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we approximate the solution $ u(x) $ as a linear combination of basis functions $ N_{i}(x)$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u(x) = \\sum_{i=Ι} u_iNi(x) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v(x) = N_{j}(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$u_{i}$: in case of Isogeometric Analysis these coefficients correspond to the control points. These control points are the unknowns that we solve for in the system of equations. In IGA, the geometry of the domain and the approximation of the solution are both represented using the same set of basis functions (e.g., B-splines or NURBS). The process involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Geometry Representation: The physical geometry of the domain is defined using control points and basis functions. For example, the shape of the domain is represented as a combination of basis functions and their corresponding control points in the geometric space.\n",
    "- Solution Approximation: The approximate solution $ u(x) $ is expressed as a linear combination of the same basis functions used for geometry, but with a different set of control points that represent the solution values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the control points in the solution approximation are analogous to nodal values in the traditional finite element method (FEM). They represent the values of the solution at specific locations in the parametric domain, which are determined by solving the system of equations derived from the weak form of the governing differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it all ties together:\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis functions $ N_{i}(x) $ are predefined and depend on the choice of the knot vector and the degree of the basis functions.\n",
    "The control points $ u_i $ are the unknowns that we need to determine. They scale the basis functions to construct the approximate solution\n",
    "$u(x)$.\n",

    "Let's assume that we want to use Cubic basis functions instead of the Quadratic ones we used in our previous analysis steps.This can be found elsewhere as p-refinement, which is the method where the degree of the basis functions used for representing the geometry is increased. Firstly, we will need to adjust the knot vector for the higher order basis fucntions. When we perform degree elevation from degree $ p $ to degree $ p + 1$, the multiplicity of the knots is typically increased to maintain the same continuity across the knots. We basically need to increase the multiplicity of all knots so that the continuity requirements are met, as before. The knot vector will now become:\n",

The traction force of $ 10 kN/m $ is applied at both ends in x-direction. The plate is modeled by taking two linear elements in both $u$ and $v$ directions. Since two linear elements are considered, three control points are required along each parametric direction, which results in a total of nine control points. Assemble the global stiffness matrix."

    "\n",
    "- The Kronecker Product method can simplify the construction of a global stiffness matrix by leveraging tensor products, especially when the problem has separable properties along the u- and v- directions, as in some simplified plate models. In this approach, you are trying to move from the 1D stiffness matrix (like a bar) to a 2D stiffness matrix by constructing the global stiffness matrix as a Kronecker product of two 1D matrices. Without the $B$ and $D$ matrices, you’re essentially working with a simplified model where the strain-displacement relationship might be implicit or trivial. The Kronecker product approach is mainly geometric — it’s less about the detailed mechanics and more about assembling the matrix structure based on pre-computed 1D solutions. The Challenge: Without the $B$ matrix (strain-displacement) and $D$ matrix (material properties), you are not explicitly capturing how nodal displacements lead to internal strains within the element. In finite element analysis (FEA) and some isogeometric analysis (IGA) applications, these matrices are fundamental to linking the displacements of the control points (knots) to the actual deformation and stress distribution inside the element. If your problem is sufficiently simple, or if it's known that displacements and strains are related in a direct way (such as uniform or linear strain distribution  across the element), you can get away with using the Kronecker product. But in general, for more complex or realistic problems, omitting $B$ and $D$ will not give accurate results for strain-stress relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Minimum Potential Energy Theorem with B and D matrices is the more general and robust approach used in FEA or IGA. The strain-displacement matrix B is derived from the shape functions, and the constitutive matrix D represents the material properties. These are used to form the element's stiffness matrix. The B matrix links the displacements of the element's control points (knots in IGA or nodes in traditional FEA) to the strains inside the element. Strains are computed as the gradient of the displacement field, and the B matrix encodes this relationship. The D matrix, meanwhile, relates these strains to stresses via the material's constitutive law (e.g. Hooke's law for linear elasticity).\n",

    "In finite element analysis (FEA), the constitutive matrix $D$ plays a key role in relating stress and strain within a material according to the material's constitutive law. It is sometimes referred to as the material stiffness matrix, and its form depends on the type of material and the dimensionality of the problem (1D, 2D, 3D). Here's an explanation of $D$ and its significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Definition of the Constitutive Matrix $D$**\n",
    "\n",
    "The constitutive matrix $D$ relates the stress vector $\\sigma$ to the strain vector $\\varepsilon$ through the constitutive equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma = D \\varepsilon\n",

    "- $ \\sigma $ is the stress vector, typically containing components like normal and shear stresses.\n",
    "- $ \\varepsilon $ is the strain vector, containing normal and shear strains.\n",
    "- $ D $ is the constitutive matrix that encodes the material properties like Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio for isotropic materials, or more complex behavior for anisotropic materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Form of the Constitutive Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "The form of $D$ depends on the type of material and the dimensionality of the problem. For simplicity, let's consider two common cases: plane stress and plane strain in 2D analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### a) **Plane Stress Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of plane stress, the stress state is assumed to be zero in the thickness direction (e.g., thin plates). The constitutive matrix $D$ for an isotropic material in plane stress is given by:\n",

    "\n",
    "##### b) **Plane Strain Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of plane strain (e.g., thick structures where strains in the thickness direction are negligible), the constitutive matrix for an isotropic material is slightly different:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In plane strain, there is no strain in the out-of-plane direction, but the stress in that direction is not zero. This requires modifying the constitutive matrix compared to the plane stress case.\n",

    "#### 3. **3D Constitutive Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "For 3D problems, the constitutive matrix $D$ becomes a 6x6 matrix, taking into account the three normal stresses and three shear stresses:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This form is more general and applies to 3D elements where stresses and strains occur in all three directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Summary of $D$**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The constitutive matrix $D$ encapsulates the material properties and links stress to strain.\n",
    "- Its specific form depends on the type of material behavior (isotropic, anisotropic, etc.) and the dimensionality (2D plane stress/strain, 3D).\n",
    "- For isotropic materials, $D$ is usually expressed in terms of Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$, but for more complex materials, $D$ can include other parameters like shear modulus, thermal expansion, or even anisotropic coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $D$ serves as a fundamental tool in converting the strains computed from nodal displacements into stresses, which are critical for determining material behavior under load.\n"

    "For More Complex Elements: If you were dealing with higher-dimensional problems, nonlinear materials, or nonlinear shape functions, then expressing and utilizing the strain-displacement matrix would be more relevant and necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, you can proceed with assembling the global stiffness matrix using the stiffness matrices you computed for each element without needing to separately express the strain-displacement matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the order of basis functions increases in Finite Element Analysis (FEM) or Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), the complexity of the stiffness matrix computation increases. Here are some strategies and considerations for assembling the stiffness matrix efficiently, especially when dealing with higher-order basis functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix Sparsity:\n",
    "Exploiting Sparsity: The stiffness matrix is often sparse, meaning many of its entries are zero. This sparsity can be exploited to save memory and computational time. Utilize sparse matrix data structures and operations to handle large matrices efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Band Structure: \n",
    "For 1D problems, matrices typically have a banded structure, which can be leveraged to reduce computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assembly Process Optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Assembly: Compute the element stiffness matrices locally and then assemble them into the global matrix. This localized approach helps manage memory and computational resources more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient Indexing: Use efficient indexing schemes to assemble the global matrix from local element matrices, minimizing the overhead involved in matrix operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel Processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Element-wise Parallelism: Since the computation for each element is independent of others, the assembly process can be parallelized. Assign different elements to different processors or threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration Parallelism: Numerical integration over each element can also be parallelized, where different integration points or elements are processed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix Compression and Storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse Matrix Formats: \n",
    "Use compressed sparse row (CSR) or compressed sparse column (CSC) formats to store and manipulate sparse matrices efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient Memory Usage: \n",
    "Employ techniques such as block storage or hierarchical data structures to manage large matrices and reduce memory overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithmic Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast Matrix Operations: Use optimized libraries for matrix operations, such as BLAS or LAPACK, which are implemented with high efficiency and can handle large-scale problems effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preconditioning: \n",
    "For iterative solvers, use preconditioners to improve convergence rates and reduce computational time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel Approaches\n",
    "Domain Decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial Decomposition: Divide the domain into smaller subdomains that can be processed independently. Each subdomain can be handled by a separate processor, with communication between processors to handle boundary conditions and data exchange.\n",
    "Task Parallelism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Separate Tasks: Break down the assembly process into separate tasks (e.g., integration, matrix assembly) that can be executed concurrently. Distribute these tasks across multiple processors or cores.\n",
    "Data Parallelism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix Operations: For matrix operations that are inherently parallel, such as matrix multiplication or factorization, use parallel algorithms to speed up computations.\n",
    "GPU Acceleration:\n",
    "\n",
    "Leverage GPUs: Use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for highly parallelizable operations, such as matrix assembly and integration. GPUs can handle large-scale computations more efficiently than CPUs in many cases.\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "In summary, when dealing with higher-order basis functions and the corresponding stiffness matrices, the following approaches can enhance efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use adaptive or higher-order quadrature for accurate integration.\n",
    "Exploit matrix sparsity and banded structures.\n",
    "Optimize the assembly process with local computations and efficient indexing.\n",
    "Utilize parallel processing for both element computations and integration.\n",
    "Apply matrix compression techniques and optimized libraries.\n",
    "Consider domain decomposition and task parallelism for large-scale problems.\n",
    "By incorporating these strategies, you can handle the increased complexity of higher-order basis functions more efficiently and effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    " OPTIONAL:\n",
    "- Python script to create the B-Splines and control them.\n",
    "- Python script to visualize each step of the procedure and how the control points will be moved after the solution and how the new geometry will be described.\n",
    "- Write the domains which should run in parallel. There is no interdependency so it is feasible to parallelize."
