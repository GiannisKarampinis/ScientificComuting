### Problem Description

The differential equation is given by:

$$
y' = -y + x + 1, \quad 0 \leq x \leq 1
$$

The initial condition is:

$$
y(0) = 1
$$

Solve the above equation with Euler's method, assuming that $n = 10$. Calculate the error between the approximate and the analytical solution of the ODE, if the analytical solution of the ODE is:

$$
y(x) = x + e^{-x}
$$
